				<p>Transforms are very similar to transitions, they provide another option for changing the appearance of elements. We can change things in both the two dimensional manner and a three dimensional manner. Let's look at some of the two dimensional transform options. We're gonna to talk about translate, rotate, scale, skew and matrix, and how each one of these can work within your CSS3.</p>
				<p>The first option I'm going to show you is translate. What translate will do is that you can give it two values, I've called them x and y and depending on those values, you can move the element to the left and right or up and down. If x is positive, you move off to the right, if it's negative you move to the left. With y, if it's positive you move down and if it's negative you move up. So let's look at an actual example to make it a little bit more clear. Here, I've got this nice blue element. And what I'm about to say is that I want to translate it, 100 and 75. So you're going to expect to see it move off to the right and down a little bit.</p>
				<p>The next option is rotate. When you rotate something, you are rotating, or I kind of like to think of it as spinning the element, a certain number of degrees. You don't see the spin. You just see the result or what it would look like at the end. So here I have another element and I'm gonna tell it to rotate by 30 degrees. So from here, to here. Now it's really important that remember to put the deg. If you just put 30, many of the browsers are not going to have that work. In fact, most of them won't. So make sure you give it the degrees you want it to turn, some sort of number, 30, 90, 80, and then use degree.</p>
